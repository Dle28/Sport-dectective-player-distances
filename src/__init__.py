"""
Top-level package for the sport detective player distance project.

This package provides a modular pipeline for:
- Detecting football players in broadcast footage.
- Tracking their identities over time.
- Classifying team membership.
- Mapping image coordinates to pitch coordinates.
- Computing physical metrics such as distance covered.
- Generating heatmaps and visual overlays.

Modules are intentionally lightweight and extensible. See individual
submodules for more detailed documentation.
